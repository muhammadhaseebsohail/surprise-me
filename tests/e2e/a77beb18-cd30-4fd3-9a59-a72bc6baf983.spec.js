Frontend Testing:
---

For frontend testing, we will be using Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests and Cypress for E2E tests.

Unit Tests:
---
1. Test Case: Verify that login form renders correctly.
   - Expected Result: All elements of the form such as username field, password field, and submit button should render correctly.

2. Test Case: Verify that the form validation works correctly.
   - Expected Result: Form should not submit when fields are empty or incorrect. Error messages should appear.

3. Test Case: Verify that successful login redirects to the homepage.
   - Expected Result: After successful login, the user should be redirected to the homepage.

4. Test Case: Verify that homepage loads correctly.
   - Expected Result: All elements of the homepage should load correctly.

E2E Tests:
---
1. Test Case: Verify that the user can successfully log in and get redirected to the homepage.
   - Expected Result: User should be able to enter credentials, submit the form, and get redirected to the homepage.

2. Test Case: Verify the user is unable to login with incorrect credentials.
   - Expected Result: The user should see an error message when trying to log in with incorrect credentials.

Backend Testing:
---
For backend testing, we will be using pytest for Python/FastAPI tests.

1. Test Case: Test if the login API endpoint accepts and validates correct user credentials.
   - Expected Result: The API should return a success status and user data when correct credentials are provided.

2. Test Case: Test if the login API endpoint rejects incorrect user credentials.
   - Expected Result: The API should return an error status and message when incorrect credentials are provided.

3. Test Case: Test if the login API endpoint handles empty input fields correctly.
   - Expected Result: The API should return an error status and message when the input fields are empty.

4. Test Case: Test if the login API endpoint is secure against SQL injection attacks.
   - Expected Result: The API should return an error status and not execute any malicious SQL command when such are included in the credentials.

5. Test Case: Test if the login API endpoint is secure against brute force attacks.
   - Expected Result: The API should implement rate-limiting and return an error status after a certain number of failed login attempts.

6. Test Case: Test if the homepage API endpoint returns the correct data.
   - Expected Result: The API should return the correct homepage data.

7. Test Case: Test if the homepage API endpoint handles errors correctly.
   - Expected Result: The API should return an error status and message when there's a server error.

Remember to follow best practices for test organization, such as grouping related tests together and making use of setup and teardown procedures where necessary.
