In the given code, you already have Pydantic models for the request and response. The `ProductCreate` model is used for creating a new product and the `Product` model is used for response of the API endpoint. 

However, there's no need for request models in the given scenario as we are only fetching data and not sending any data to the server. So, we just need response models which we already have, i.e., Product.

```python
# Pydantic Models
class ProductBase(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: str
    price: float

class ProductCreate(ProductBase):
    is_featured: bool = False

class Product(ProductBase):
    id: int
    is_featured: bool

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

In the API endpoint `/products/featured`, we are using the `Product` model as the response model.

```python
@app.get("/products/featured", response_model=List[Product])
async def get_featured_products(session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    """
    Retrieve featured products
    """
    product_service = ProductService(session)
    products = await product_service.get_featured_products()
    if not products:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Featured products not found")
    return products
```

In the service layer, we are returning a list of `Product` objects which is a database model. This is also a kind of Data Transfer Object (DTO).

```python
# Service Layer
class ProductService:
    def __init__(self, session: AsyncSession):
        self.session = session

    async def get_featured_products(self) -> List[Product]:
        result = await self.session.execute(select(Product).where(Product.is_featured == True))
        return result.scalars().all()
```
