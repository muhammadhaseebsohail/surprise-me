**Test Plan Document**

**1. Test Objectives:**

The objectives for testing are:
   - Verify the functional aspects of the login.
   - Carry out usability testing for the homepage.
   - Conduct security testing for the login.

**2. Test Scope:**

The scope of testing includes:
   - Frontend: Login page, Homepage
   - Backend: Authentication API

**3. Test Cases with Expected Results:**

**Functional Testing of Login:**

   - TC1: Enter valid username and password. Expected Result: Successful login and user is redirected to the homepage.
   - TC2: Enter invalid username and password. Expected Result: Error message displayed.
   - TC3: Enter valid username and invalid password. Expected Result: Error message displayed.
   - TC4: Enter invalid username and valid password. Expected Result: Error message displayed.
   - TC5: Click on forgot password link. Expected Result: User is redirected to password recovery page.

**Usability Testing of Homepage:**

   - TC6: Check the load time of homepage. Expected Result: The homepage should load within 2 seconds.
   - TC7: Check the responsiveness of the homepage on different devices. Expected Result: The homepage should be responsive on all devices.
   - TC8: Check the readability and understandability of the content on the homepage. Expected Result: The user should be able to understand the content easily.

**Security Testing of Login:**

   - TC9: Attempt SQL injection attack on login. Expected Result: The application should not be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
   - TC10: Attempt brute force attack on login. Expected Result: After a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, the account should be locked.
   - TC11: Check the transmission of data during login. Expected Result: The data should be encrypted during transmission.

**4. Test Data Requirements:**

   - Valid and invalid usernames and passwords for testing login functionality.
   - Different device configurations for testing homepage responsiveness.
   - Different types of attack vectors for security testing.

**5. Test Environment Setup:**

   - Frontend testing: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests.
   - Backend testing: pytest for Python/FastAPI tests.

**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

   - All the functional, usability, and security test cases pass.
   - The homepage is responsive on all devices and is user-friendly.
   - The application is not vulnerable to any security attack.
   - The application should meet all the requirements specified in the user stories. If any requirement is not met, the bug should be reported, fixed, and retested until the requirement is fulfilled.
